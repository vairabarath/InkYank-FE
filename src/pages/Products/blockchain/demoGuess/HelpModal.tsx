                  GuessCoin is a simple and fun blockchain-based guessing game.
                  Your goal is to correctly guess a secret number within a set
                  range. Itâ€™s a game of chance, secured by cryptography to
                  ensure fairness.

                    Increment Count" slider to decide how far into the future
                    you want to aim. A value of '20' means you're targeting a
                    block that will be mined 20 blocks after the current one.

                    section, you need an "Actual Hash" (your prediction) and a
                    "Secret Key Hash". You can either paste your own
                    64-character hex values or click "GENERATE" to create random
                    ones.

                    "Power Hammers". This is a key part of the strategy!

                    to be mined by the network, then click "FETCH RESULT" to see

                    <p>
                      A: Think of it as a unique, unpredictable serial number
                      for a blockchain block. It's generated by a complex
                      cryptographic process. Our game is all about trying to
                      predict this serial number before it's created.

                    <p>
                      A: It's part of the game's security. It's combined with
                      your main prediction to create a "Dummy Hash", which
                      ensures your guess is locked in fairly without being
                      revealed until you check the results.

                    <p>
                      Predicting an entire 64-character hash is nearly
                      impossible. A better strategy is to analyze patterns and
                      try to predict smaller token sequences. Adjusting the
                      "Token Size" slider changes your strategy for what kind of
                      sequences you're trying to match.
